These here are precious.  These are the files of lurker.

You will need:
* python irc library (GPL)
* python itself (most implementations of 2.0 should work)

I, Robbie Harwood (frozencemetery) <rharwood@club.cc.cmu.edu>, do hereby claim
responsibility for breathing life into this organism and release him unto your
care through the power of the GPL.  May lurker run free and grow in your
hands, on IRC as in here.
